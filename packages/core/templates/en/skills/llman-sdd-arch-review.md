# LLMAN SDD Architecture Review

Scan the codebase for architectural friction and surface **deepening opportunities** — refactors that turn shallow modules (interface nearly equals implementation) into deep ones (lots of behaviour behind a small interface). The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

## Pipeline position

Auxiliary tool, not part of the main pipeline (explore→propose→apply→verify→archive). Usable at any stage; commonly triggered during explore to surface improvement candidates.

> 📍 Standalone optional skill; does not replace any pipeline stage.

## Design vocabulary

A set of words about module shape, used to articulate "where it's worth changing". MUST NOT substitute "component" / "service" / "API" / "boundary" (they are broader, less precise):

- **Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation (function/class/package/cross-layer slice).
- **Interface** — everything a caller must know to use it correctly: type signature, plus invariants, ordering constraints, error modes, performance characteristics.
- **Depth** — the amount of behaviour behind the interface. **Deep** = lots of behaviour behind a small interface; **shallow** = interface nearly as complex as the implementation (the caller saves nothing).
- **Seam** — a place where you can swap the implementation without editing call sites (where the interface lives). In llman, seam = the public boundary driven by `*.feature` GWT steps.
- **Leverage** — what callers get from depth: more capability per unit of interface learned.
- **Locality** — what maintainers get from depth: changes/bugs/knowledge/verification concentrate in one place.

## Steps

### 1. Explore (scope first, YAGNI)
- If the user named a direction (module/subsystem/pain point), accept it; skip inference.
- Otherwise walk `git log --oneline` for hot spots (files/areas that keep coming up).
- Prefer reading live `<capability>.feature` (single-track SSOT) and `design.md` (existing ADRs); MUST NOT create a `CONTEXT.md`.
- Use the Agent tool (`subagent_type=Explore`) to walk the codebase, noting friction:
  - Does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
  - Where are modules **shallow** (interface nearly as complex as the implementation)?
  - Where are pure functions extracted only for testability, but real bugs hide in how they're called (no locality)?
  - Which parts are untested or hard to test through their current interface?

### 2. Present candidates
For each candidate:
- **Files** — which files/modules are involved.
- **Problem** — why the current architecture causes friction (use depth/leverage/locality).
- **Solution** — plain-English description of what would change.
- **Benefits** — locality and leverage improvements; how tests get better.
- **Recommendation strength** — `Strong` / `Worth exploring` / `Speculative`.

**Deletion test**: for any suspected-shallow module, imagine deleting it — does complexity vanish (it's just a pass-through, no value) or reappear across N call sites (it's actually earning its keep)? "Reappears" is the signal you want.

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing `design.md` decision, surface it only when the friction is real enough to warrant reopening, and mark it in the candidate.

### 3. Grilling (after the user picks a candidate)
Run `llman-sdd-explore`'s **grilling branch** (trigger "deep-dig") to walk the decision tree — constraints, dependencies, the deepened module's shape, what sits behind the seam, which tests survive.

- A deepened module uses a concept not in the capability `.feature`? → update live `.feature` **only** if the change already has Branch binding and you are on the bound branch (Specs landing); otherwise STOP and route to `llman-sdd-propose` / `change start` — **never** edit live specs on the default branch.
- User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason? → offer an ADR only when "hard to reverse + surprising without context + real trade-off" all hold; record in `design.md`.

## Output
Candidate list (text; optional HTML report written to OS temp dir, not the repo) + the grilling decision record after the user picks one (write back to proposal; contract edits only via Specs landing into live `.feature`).

> For command details run `llman sdd <cmd> --help`; the CLI is the command reference — skills embed no command tables.
> "Spec" here = a `.feature` file under this project's `llmanspec/specs/`; run `llman sdd list --specs` or `llman sdd show <capability>`.
