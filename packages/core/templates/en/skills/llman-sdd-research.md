# LLMAN SDD Research

Spin up a **background agent** to do the research, so you keep working while it reads.

## Pipeline position

Auxiliary tool, usable at any stage. Common in explore/wayfinder to provide factual input for decisions. Output is written back to the change's proposal "Further Notes" section for later stages to consume.

> 📍 Standalone optional skill; research output feeds the main flow's explore/propose.

## Responsibilities

The background agent's job:

1. Investigate the question against **primary sources** — official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs — not secondary write-ups. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it.
2. Write findings to a single Markdown file, citing each claim's source.
3. Save location (follow the repo's own convention if it has one): **default** to `llmanspec/changes/<current-change>/research/<topic>.md` (change docs, **not** live specs). Write to `docs/research/` only when the topic spans multiple changes and will still be referenced after archiving; **never** put single-change decisions or decaying deep-dives into `docs/research/`.
4. **MUST NOT** edit `llmanspec/specs/**` in this skill. If research shows MUST/SHALL must change → suggest `llman-sdd-propose` (Branch binding → Specs landing).

## Steps

1. Clarify the research question (confirm with the user; if fuzzy, sharpen to a falsifiable one).
2. Use the Agent tool `subagent_type=general-purpose` + `run_in_background: true` to launch the background research, with a prompt containing:
   - The question statement.
   - A requirement to cite only primary sources, with source URL/path per claim.
   - The output file path (default `llmanspec/changes/<id>/research/<topic>.md`).
   - A word limit (suggested: focus on facts, prose narrative < 1500 words).
3. Continue main-flow work while it runs in the background; receive a notification when done.
4. Read the output, summarize key conclusions back into the current change's `proposal.md` "Further Notes" section (with a file pointer).
5. If the research reveals a decision is needed, suggest entering `llman-sdd-explore`'s grilling branch.

## Cooperation with wayfinder

`llman-sdd-wayfinder`'s research tickets delegate to this skill for background resolution; on completion, write back to the ticket proposal and record a one-line gist in the map's Decisions-so-far.

> For command details run `llman sdd <cmd> --help`; the CLI is the command reference — skills embed no command tables.
> "Spec" here = a `.feature` file under this project's `llmanspec/specs/`; run `llman sdd list --specs` or `llman sdd show <capability>`.
